The name of the blog was based on an <a href="/post/Articles/SoftMeth.pdf">article</a> I wrote where I give a brief historical survey of software development methods, culminating in agile methods. Even though the article is 15 years old, it still has many interesting things to say. </p><hr /><p><b>About the Author:</b><i> Aron has worked over 35 years for high-tech companies in the US and Israel. He served in senior positions doing technical development and software project management. As one of the original developers of Statemate, a statechart simulation tool, he was a co-winner of the <a href="http://awards.acm.org/award_winners/trauring_5898826">2007 ACM Software System award </a>(Statecharts are now part of the Unified Modeling Language). For many years he also served in senior positions doing international sales and marketing for major high tech companies. A serial entrepreneur who co-founded one of the earliest successful interactive media agencies, an Internet B2B services company as well as a software startup which developed a patented data security/privacy platform.</i></p><p><i>Aron currently serves as the CIO of <a href="http://emelai.io">Emelai.</a></i></p><hr/>
<p>Knowing you likely are <em>not</em> going to read it, here is a quote from the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is fitting that this white paper is being written a few weeks after Professor Edsger Dijkstra passed on. In March, 1968 Dr. Dijkstra published an influential letter to the editor of the Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery (CACM) called <em>Go To Statement Considered Harmful</em>. The impact of this letter was analogous in some ways to Martin Luther’s posting of his 95 Theses on the church door in Wittenberg. Like the latter, Dijkstra’s letter inaugurated a religious war which continues to this day.</p>
  <p>I don’t mean to be either sacrilegious or flippant by this statement. While software development may not be as important an activity as looking after one’s soul, it does have enormous impact on everyone’s material life — but not just. Every time I board a plane, which is quite often, I think to myself how much my safety depends on some programmer getting it right. This is not a very comforting thought to anyone who is even slightly involved in this industry.</p>
  <p>How we develop software matters: doing it properly reduces the risk of economic failure, of personal failure in one’s career (if you are in the field), and, most importantly, for some systems it reduces the risk of lives being lost.</p>

<p>My main contention in that article is that the best book a software developer or manager can read about development methods is Fred Brooks' <em>The Mythical Man Month</em>. Despite the anachronistic name, there is nothing outdated about the book. If you haven't yet, stop now and go read it. Or at least read my distallation in the above-mentioned article. This distallation I call the <em>Mythical Man Month Method(ology)</em>. Hence the etymology of FourM, a wonderful neologism which I refuse to change to MPMM.</p>
<p>One of the points that I make in the article, and which has only been reinforced over the past 15 years, is that FOSS (free and open source software) is so successful and important precisely because it embodies FourM in many ways. Another key point I made is that many new tools and techniques had been developed for the software world in the years since Brooks wrote his book (even the Anniversary edition). So while the magical "silver bullet" to make software development easy did not yet exist when I started that blog nearly 15 years ago, much of importance had happened, including FOSS itself. The purpose of the blog was to elaborate and provide examples of these two points.</p><h2 id="fourm---tng" class="Styles-hoverBox">FourM - TNG<a href="#fourm---tng" class=" Styles-hoverLink"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
<p>15 years on, there is still no "silver bullet." But many, many, new, important and useful tools and techniques have been developed. In particular, the rise of the Internet has given birth to a cadre of software giants along with software startups that are building ever more capable and useful tools and techniques, that are being shared via FOSS and the Internet itself. The craft of software development has never been easier, or more fun and interesting.</p>
<p>This renewed version of the blog came about because I am learning many of these new technologies, and I know the best way to learn is to teach. Besides writing, I hope to also add some video, but time will tell if that works out. I also will be re-sharing some of the older material from the previous blog which is still relevant.</p>
<p>The technology behind this blog itself is a great example of some of the new tools and techniques. It is a fork of the blog created by <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com">Li Haoyi</a> based on one of my new favorite tools, Ammonite. My many thanks to the author for his highly useful tools. I strongly suggest people contribute to his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lihaoyi">Patreon</a>.</p>
<p>In the previous incarnation of this blog, I was a big proponent of Python, and the blog itself was built on <a href="https://plone.org">Plone</a>. In the past couple of years I have become a huge fan of Scala and functional programming. Those are one big focus of this blog.</p>
<p>Another big focus is "the cloud" which is one of the most radical and productive changes in software development in the past few years. Related to this is a fascinating change that has happened to Microsoft. Not many probably remember how Bill Gates compared FOSS to communism! Today, Microsoft has joined IBM as one of the biggest proponents of and contributor to FOSS. Azure is an amazing set of products, and I hope to cover it extensively. If any company can be seen as the new "Microsoft" of the software world, it's Amazon. Sadly, AWS has way to much of the bad old concept of customer lock-in. Nonetheless, since it is widely used, it will be covered as well.</p>
<p>Over the years I have fulfilled many roles in companies, my own and others. In terms of my technical roles, programming has always been a tool I use, but I would define myself more as a plumbing person. Which means, I am best at defining and building the architecture and infrastructure that holds software projects together, rather than coming up with nifty new algorithms. A big part of that is today called DevOps and that is another key focal point for the blog.</p><div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: space-between;"><div></div><div></div></div></div></body></html>
