      <description>Anti-Intellectual Semantics Not too long ago, someone on Gitter called me (or, more precisely, something I said) “anti-intellectual.” I was more than a bit amused, and somewhat surprised and pleased by this accusation. The fact is, for much of my life I have been labeled by both friends and family, often in an accusatory tone, as being overly intellectual. The funniest part about this interchange is that it was part of a discussion on how prevalent is the use of functional programming (FP) by Scala programmers!</description>
